<p>The two pieces above were produced as part of my research about online platforms for independent and grassroots music production. The production processes of the tracks were part of a broader investigation about working and production conditions for grassroots musicians and aspiring professional producers who participate in online remixing contests. These contexts offer participants the opportunity to practice their musical skills using professional-grade audio content, but, when structured as a commercial enterprise, remixing contests are marred by potential exploitative practices and unethical procedures (such as unfair rewards and appropriation of intellectual property). The two tracks presented here were made as part of a contest held at CCMixter.org, an ethically sound platform for online remixing which embraces a collaborative co-creation ethos (via Creative Commons licenses and Open Access ethos) and fosters community support in an online environment that blends User-generated Content and social media elements. These tracks are hosted in the CCMixter.org website in accordance to the licenses and user agreement for non-commercial use.

Audio recordings were made as part of a field recording workshop hosted in Hangar cultural centre (hangar.org) using entry-level audio recording equipment (Tascam DR-1). The piece aims to provide the listener with the soundscapes of a walk starting from the commercial sector of neighbourhood towards the sea-side on a sunny weekend afternoon. No synthesised audio was used, only original field-recordings manipulated and edited digitally with minimal use of sound effects.
